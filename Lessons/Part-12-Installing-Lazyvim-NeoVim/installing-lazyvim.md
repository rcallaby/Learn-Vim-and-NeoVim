# Installing LazyVim in NeoVim

The `lazy.vim` is a Neovim plugin that provides a set of shortcuts and configurations to enhance the productivity of programmers. It's designed to make Neovim behave more like a modern IDE. In this tutorial, I'll guide you through the process of installing and configuring `lazy.vim` and demonstrate some of its key features.

### Step 1: Install `lazy.vim`
To get started, you'll need to install the `lazy.vim` plugin. You can do this using a plugin manager like `vim-plug`, `dein.vim`, or `packer.nvim`. For this tutorial, I'll assume you're using `vim-plug`.

1. Open your Neovim configuration file (usually `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`).
2. Add the following line to install `lazy.vim` using `vim-plug`:

```bash
Plug 'kdheepak/lazy.vim'
```

3. Save the file and run the following command inside Neovim:

```bash
:source %
:PlugInstall
```

### Step 2: Basic Configuration
After installing `lazy.vim`, you can customize its behavior to suit your preferences. Here are some basic configurations you might find useful:

```vim
" Enable lazy.vim
let g:lazy_enabled = 1

" Set font size (adjust as per your preference)
let g:lazy_font_size = 14

" Set line numbers (optional)
set number

" Enable auto-save (optional)
let g:lazy_auto_save = 1
```
